The data to be used for the time delay estimation algorithm is saved in the file time_delay_est_data.mat

The file contains a single MATLAB data structure variable that is defined as:

data.x1 : the original discrete time signal
data.x2: the delayed discrete time signal by some time offset
data.t: the continuos time vector associated with both signals
data.Fs: sampling rate used for each signal
