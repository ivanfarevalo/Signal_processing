# Fourier Series Expansion

The purpose of this assignment is to understand the Fourier Series Expansion and acquire a graphical intuition for this representation. We will be deriving the Fourier Series Expansion for a simple function, graphing the phasors corresponding to the fourier expansion and plotting the projection of the real axis with respect to time. We will understand how the phasors move with respect to the unit circle by analyzing how each fourier coefficient corresponds to the magnitude of a complex exponential that determines the vectorâ€™s rotational speed.
